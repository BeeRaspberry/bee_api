## Reporting a Vulnerability

Every effort is made to remediate security risks prior to publishing software to the `main` branch. 

However things happen. Security vulnerabilities are reported in between releases leaving security issues for public comnsumption.

If you discover a vulnerability then send an email to pwhite6448(at)gmail.com.
